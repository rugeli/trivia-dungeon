Welcome to my first ever full-stack project, The Trivia Ocean. In creating the project, I have utilized the skill and knowledge I acquired from Ada Developers Academy and a broad spectrum of research. As a result, I was able to understand my own potential and limitations. It truly is a pioneer project for me to explore the possibilities of full-stack development.

The back story of designing this game is that my family can enjoy it together. In the game, each one of us can choose a favorite category to play. And by signing up, each player gets to save the score. In addition, there is a leaderboard where players can race for the top spot.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
